Reference Images
================

These images are annotated views from the simulator with only selected areas
turned on in contrasting colors. The numbering is for logical panels, so the
numbers would have a "p" or a "b" after them to form a full panel address.

Things are mostly symetrical with some exceptions of course.

Panel 19 is only on the business side. It's the cutout for the DJ booth on
the party side.

The top of the head at panels 63 & 64 are modeled as two triangles on the
party side, but on the business side there is a single quadrangle mapped to
63b. I'm unsure what reality is.

Small panels at the top of the shoulder 44 & 45 are modeled on the party side
but are absent from the model of the business side. I've seen these panels
in real life though and they've fallen on my head and made me bleed, so I'm
pretty sure they exist.

The feet are mapped, although in RL they are unlit. Panels 10 & 38.

On the face, some tiny surfaces around the eye sockets are not numbered or
mapped at all. I'm pretty sure these will not be lit. The nose is mapped, but
I do not believe it will be lit. This should be just panels 73,74,75,77,78,79,82.

If the nose does get lit, we may have one or two unmapped RL panels. There is
space at 71 & 72 in the numbering for those if we need it.

On the party side, panels 86, 87, & 88 are covered with wire but not tool so 
that the driver can see through them. These will probably not be lit.

Some panels on the centerline exist on the party side but not the business
side. These are

    * 83 - The breastplate/neck
    * 72 - Top of the head
    * 52 - Top of the rear above the tail
    * 50 - The tail itself

Panels 55 on the tail, and 89 on the breastplate, are two panels that come
together, but are indeed separate panels. Because the simulator colored them
the same becase 55p & 55b have the same number, this might appear a little
confusing in the pictures.
