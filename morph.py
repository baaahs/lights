Functions to generate attractive 'morphs' between colors

All morphs are simple linear progressions between 2 or more points
in the HSV colorspace.  These functions merely produce sequences of
colors - determining the time each color should be shown or
the overall duration of the animation is a detail that the library
user must handle.

All functions take and return Color objects

There are two main functions you'll want to use.  The first
generates a simple linear transition between two Colors:

- color_transition(start_color, end_color, steps=20)

The second generates a transition between a list of colors:

- multistep_color_transition(rgb_points, steps=20, continuous=False)

Takes a list of Color points and returns a sequence that
transitions between all points.
Can optionally generate a sequence that cycles, returning an
infinite list of colors useful for indefinite length
animations
